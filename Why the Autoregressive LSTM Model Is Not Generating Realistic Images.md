# üß† Why the Autoregressive LSTM Model Is Not Generating Realistic Images

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What Autoregressive Generation Means
An **autoregressive (AR)** model predicts the probability of each pixel given all previous pixels.

During training, it minimizes **negative log-likelihood (NLL)** (cross-entropy), and during sampling, it generates pixels sequentially in raster order.  
Every pixel depends on all those before it ‚Äî making image generation slow and unstable.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Your Current Model Works
- The generator is an **LSTM** predicting **3√ó256 logits (RGB)** per pixel across 32√ó32 = 1024 steps.
- Each step uses:
  - The **previous pixel** (as input)
  - A **global noise vector (z)**
  - A **positional encoding**
- Sampling happens **pixel-by-pixel**, which is computationally heavy and sensitive to errors.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Why It Fails to Generate Realistic Images

| Code | Issue | Explanation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| (a) | **Gradient Problems** | Backpropagation through 1000+ LSTM steps causes vanishing/exploding gradients. The model learns only colors, not shapes. |
| (b) | **Weak GAN Signal** | The discriminator only judges the final image, so the generator receives weak and unstable feedback. |
| (c) | **Inefficient Pixel Factorization** | Each pixel is modeled independently, ignoring spatial relationships. |
| (d) | **Simple Output Distribution** | RGB channels are predicted separately using 256-way softmax, losing color correlation. |
| (e) | **Sampling Error Accumulation** | Small prediction errors accumulate during generation, producing noisy or chaotic images. |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ How Modern Models Solve This

| Model | Core Idea | Advantage |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **PixelCNN** | Masked convolutions | Stable, parallel training; preserves spatial locality. |
| **VQ-VAE + GPT** | Discrete latent tokens | Shorter sequences; coherent global structure. |
| **Diffusion Models** | Denoising process | State-of-the-art image quality; stable and scalable. |
| **MaskGIT** | Masked token refinement | Fast and coherent parallel sampling. |

Modern image generators handle spatial dependencies explicitly ‚Äî avoiding the need to unroll thousands of sequential steps like an LSTM.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ How to Improve the LSTM Approach

‚úÖ **Training Improvements**
- Extend **warmup** (5k‚Äì10k NLL-only steps, AMP off for LSTM stability).
- Use **weight decay (1e-4)** and **Adam** with `Œ≤1=0.0, Œ≤2=0.999`.
- Keep **teacher forcing** = 1.0 during warmup.

‚úÖ **Model Upgrades**
- Replace 256-way softmax with a **Mixture of Logistics (DMoL)** output head.
- Use **sinusoidal positional encodings** instead of a small MLP.
- Increase hidden dimension (e.g., `hidden=768`) if VRAM allows.

‚úÖ **GAN Stability**
- Add **R1 gradient penalty** (`Œ≥=1.0`, every 16 steps).
- Keep **lr_d < lr_g** (e.g., 1e-4 vs 2e-4).
- Apply **EMA** (0.999‚Äì0.9995) to smooth generator updates.

‚úÖ **Debugging Tips**
- Train on **16√ó16** images to debug faster.
- Check that CE (cross-entropy) < 5.0 after warmup.
- Log **bits-per-dim (bpd)** as a normalized metric.

‚úÖ **Eventually Migrate**
- To **PixelCNN** for pixel-level AR with convolutional context.
- Or **VQ-VAE + GPT prior** for discrete-token autoregressive generation.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaway
Your **autoregressive LSTM-GAN** is *conceptually valid* but **practically inefficient** for 2D images.  
It learns local color distributions but fails to capture global spatial structure.

Modern alternatives (PixelCNN, VQ-VAE + GPT, Diffusion) explicitly model 2D spatial dependencies or use discrete tokens ‚Äî enabling stable, scalable, high-quality image generation.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Next Steps
1. Continue NLL-only warmup until CE < 5.0.
2. Add R1 regularization and EMA.
3. Try **VQ-VAE + GPT** or **PixelCNN** versions next.
4. Log **FID**, **bits-per-dim**, and **sample grids** in W&B for tracking progress.
